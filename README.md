# The-PLOM-Project

The Physics Laws Observer Module Project is a project to train machine learning models on tons of classical mechanics data to make them not to predict the next move **but** to observs the laws of physics without having a previous knowledge about them, this project is for studying purposes to see if machines can actually understand our world and detect its laws.
